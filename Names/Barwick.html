Consoles

Most original copies of games can be played on consoles. Consoles are indeed easier to use
and generally have less challenging  set up for the full experience. For example if your not
that good with tech, you can spend a long time trying to hook up you computer to you TV or
just get a console with instructions and all the wiring needed.
